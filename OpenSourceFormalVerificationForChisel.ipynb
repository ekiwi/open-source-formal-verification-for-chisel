We can see how the `assert` is represented as a native firrtl statement with two input: enable and predicate.\n\n```\nassert(clock, geq(out, REG), and(not(firstCycle), not(reset)), \"\") : assert\n```\n\nThe `assert` statement is triggered on every rising edge of the `clock` signal. It is only enabled when it is not the `firstCycle` and when `reset` is not active. If that is the case, then it will check that `out` is greater or equal to the value of the delay register (`REG`) that was inserted by `RegNext(out)`.\n\nThere is also a `printf` statement which gets added by the `chisel3.assert` function. This statement will be ignored by our formal tools. It is useful in simulation and since we are going to use a simulator to replay the counter example that a formal tool might provide to us, it will also be useful to debug the failure of a formal check.","metadata":{},"id":"951eeb19-75f0-4e2f-b0c0-b47b5a3c575f"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Compilation to Verilog\nLoFirrtl is normally compiled down to a simple subset of the (System)Verilog standard which works with a wide range of synthesis and verification tools.
